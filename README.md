Quota - a practical to-do list app for iOS and Android. (HoyaHacks 2016 Project)
See accompanying Android app: https://github.com/nasalomons/QuotaAndroid

Quota is a typical to-do list app for rather forgetful people; the user creates an account (with email and password),
which connects to Firebase. Then the user can add tasks to their list and remove them as he or she
completes them.

INCOMPLETE FEATURES:
Scoring system: In future updates, app will keep a score for the user's productivity. As the user completes
more tasks, their score will increase which creates an incentive to continue using the app.

Firebase integration: As of right now the user can register for, sign in to, and create an account
with Quota (which is simply connected to Firebase). However the tasks are not saved or loaded to or from
the Firebase database right now.

Saving any kind of data: As of right now the data stored in the app is temporary, that is when the user
closes the app, the tasks will not save. Obviously this makes the app nearly useless, but that will
be coming in future versions.
